# Contributing to Innovation

Innovation projects are great opportunities for flexing your technical muscles.
Not only do you learn about existing business functions (and meet some people
you might otherwise couldn't), but you contribute to developing really
interesting solutions for the future.

Fortunately, the barrier for innovation seems to lower as time goes on, and my
innovation experiences and conversations with the new hires should be reason for
lowering it even more. Let's look into how you can overcome this barrier and
start contributing to innovation projects.


## Join an Existing Project



- ask around; identify "sources of innovation" and keep up to date with them

- most importantly, advocate for yourself; make your strengths and interests
clear to others

## Start Your Own Project

**Disclaimer**: Do not rely on this approach. Discuss your ideas with others
first, ..., and limit the amount of work you do to 

- management will disagree with this approach; make sure to follow the
guidelines discussed in [the previous section](#the-roles-on-a-team) before
dedicating significant resources to your project.

## Soapbox: Innovation Project Limitations

You have an idea or want to join an interesting project. All you see are green
lights ahead of you. What could stop you from realizing your dreams?

There are some rather unexciting reasons for why your innovation dreams may come
to a halting stop or - if you're lucky - reach a fraction of the vision you had
in mind.

1. Innovation Projects are Internally Funded

Unlike client work, innovation projects do not generate revenue. Although I do
not agree with that statement (innovation projects *could* generate revenue or
lower costs), that is the greatest constraint you will face. Truly, there is no
way around this other than putting together a detailed breakdown of the supposed
benefits of your project, and even this is a loose, often unconvincing, argument
of $\text{Time Saved} \times \text{Dollars per Time} = \text{Big Money}$.

2. Innovation Projects are Doing Too Much

Have I mentioned innovation projects require a specific, narrow scope?

Innovation projects vary per project: they all try to address their own unique
problem(s) with their own unique solution(s). This itself is a major caveat we
inflict upon ourselves. Every innovation project starts from scratch when they
could be sharing resources instead. They could also share what does and doesn't
work which would prevent teams from building out these massive scopes that
ultimately lead to the their own demise.

It's unfair to point fingers, but our lack of innovation guidelines or
innovation repositories puts these projects off on a bad trajectory from the
beginning.

3. Innovation Projects are Treated Unfairly

Regardless of budget constraints or technical constraints, innovation projects
continue to be looked at as nothing more than "*passion projects*". I understand
our priorities are client work; however, that doesn't mean something that is
fundamentally "not client work" cannot eventually impact client work. If you
develop a tool that drastically changes the way we perform client work (ideally,
for the better), this should be allocated as many - if not, more - resources
than the identical time you would've spent performing client work.

If we represent innovation in audit, we should provide the necessary support for
projects that truly innovate our audit procedures.
