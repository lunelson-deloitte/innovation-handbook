Everyone has something they marvel at every time they comes across it; my marvel
is stone carving.

Stone carving is not an exact art form, but I like to think of it following
three generic steps:

- There is no sculpture without first **extracting the stone**, carefully
selecting the stone that best suits the characteristics the sculptor requires.

- There is no sculpture without **sketching the outline**, determining which
parts of the rock to chip away and which parts not to chip away given the
characteristics of the stone.

- There is no sculpture without **carving the masterpiece**, selecting the
right tools for the job given the outline sketched previously.

Sculptures require these three steps to build off of one another based on
the sculptor's needs. The sculptor should aim to make their most elegant
sculpture given the limitations of the stone they've extracted, the vision they
have in their head, and the tools they have available to them. Once they start
chipping away at the stone, they cannot replace the missing shards, only able
to work their way down to the statue inside the block of stone.


## Carving *Innovation Stones*

Unsurprisingly, we do not have stones lying around the office, although it would
be pretty cool if we did. Instead, we have ideas that have yet to be made
clear, ideas that - if given adequate resources - could elevate our existing
processes or introduce new solutions.


## Soapbox: Discussing Innovation Freely

One outcome of this book is to **encourage innovation-related discussions**.
Although this section details a rather formal approach for structuring ideas,
most innovation projects (should) start with a simple conversation. Asking
others' what they wish could be different is the perfect path to a two-way
conversation about how you can help make someone's life easier. Who wouldn't
want that?

I do think these conversations lend themselves to a couple pitfalls, some of
which I mentioned above. It is worth reiterating that the primary goals of
these conversations is to conduct "research" - you want to gather opinions
from people who can relate to the problem at hand, asking broad questions
that encourage critiques and invite solutions. Avoid coming up with solutions
within the same breath as this can negatively limit the scope of the project
from "*everything-it-could-possibly-be*" to
"*anything-you-are-comfortable-with*".
