# Opportunistic Areas

With the restrictions we have surrounding innovation, it makes working on "*really cool*" projects even tougher to come by.

The following are some areas that I believe are the Wild Wests of innovation - few, if any, have explored these areas and there is significant, unbound potential for any project addressing these fields.

## Statistics

I believe we could/should focus on developing analytics with a mathematical focus.

- introduce (more) mathematical rigor in audit procedures
- plenty of applications (probabilistic fraud detection, unsupervised learning, etc.)
- foundation for machine learning, artificial intelligence

## Data Engineering

I believe we could/should develop robust ELT/ETL pipelines.

- introduce proper pipeline methods (file i/o, sql scripts, logging)
- ...

## Software Development

I believe we could/should reduce user involvement to minimal inputs.

- specifically, app development; how can we reduce user involvement to necessary inputs?
- database architecture; how do we efficiently store/process/export data of any type?
