# Preface {-}

---

It would be an understatement to say there is *plenty* of buzz surrounding the
Audit Analytics practice. Adopting Databricks has introduced compute resources
that were previously unattainable. The recent class of new hires display a
highly technical skill set and equally passionate "*innovation-set*". Our Data
Science neighbors' work using large language models opens up a whole new realm
of revolutionizing audit procedures.

With this buzz comes a lot of great ideas, ideas that - if given adequate
resources - could truly reshape the way our group operates.

The keen reader would have noticed the rather vague phrase "if given adequate
resources." Unfortunately, the field of audit has many self-imposed, yet
arguably reasonable, limitations that negate innovative ideas.

Rather than accept these limitations and self-impose the end of our own ideas,
I'd instead like to advocate for the opposite. Given my time in this group, I
have worked on an array of innovation projects. Some are immediate fixes; others
span many months. Some only reach a few people; others impact the entire
group. Some are interesting; others are very interesting.


## What is the *The Innovation Handbook*?{- .unlisted #innovation-handbook}

[The Innovation Handbook](#innovation-handbook) is an
informal collection of resources dedicated to summarizing, discussing, and
advancing innovation in Audit Analytics. Over the course of the book, I hope to
present a generic template for any innovation project to follow. Some common
themes this book will address include:

- How do I *structure* my innovation project?

- How do innovation projects *connect* to one another?

- How could we define a "**successful**" innovation project?

This book could be read cover-to-cover or (more likely) this book could be read
as a reference guide, something to refer to for specific sections from time to
time. Given this book discusses innovation, the content may become outdated
quicker than other books; hence, frequent revisions may be required.


## What is The Scope of This Book? {- .unlisted}

Let's start with what this book is **not**.

- This book is **not a rubric for you to follow**. Part of innovating is
discussing and discovering those boundaries that define success on your own.
Although innovation projects could (and arguably should) relate to one another
in some ways, they should actively establish their own boundaries.

- This book is **not a source of truth**. Although I'd like to think that the ideas I
present here have merit, they are the result of my unique experiences. I hope
that while reading this book, you agree and disagree with what I have to say, as
this will lead to productive discussions about how we fundamentally view
innovation in Audit Analytics.

- This book is **not a manifesto**. *No political ideologies will be discussed.*

Onto the good stuff: what this book **is**.

- This book is a **philosophical debate**. One underlying tone I've observed is that
innovation is put in a faded light, something that some feel comfortable
discussing and few feel comfortable doing. I will endlessly advocate for both
those populations to increase as much as possible.

- This book is a long-winded way of saying "**anyone can innovate**." Just like
Ratatouille's *Anyone Can Cook*, everyone should have the confidence and
resources to pursue their innovative ideas.

- This book is a **work-in-progress** and always will be a work-in-progress. It would
be a shame if a book about innovation was itself not innovative.


## Soapbox: My Personal Perspective {- .unlisted}

At the end of some sections and chapters, I have added “Soapbox” sections that
give my thoughts in more detail. Typically these "thoughts" are synonymous with
"my opinions" - regardless of the underlying tone of these blocks of text, these
blocks are completely optional (as if the rest of this book isn't).
