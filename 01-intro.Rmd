# Innovation in Audit Analytics

## A Brief History

*What have the last couple years looked like for innovation in Audit Analytics?*

- discuss Rohan, `rDWW`, `AutoMemo v0`


## Modern Day

*Who/What are the "sources of innovation"?*

- argue for more "innovation-related" discussions; everyone has great ideas, just need platform to discuss them freely/frequently

- most opportunities are word of mouth; no dedicated/reliable source of innovation projects

- discuss myself + others, `AutoMemo v1`, etc.


## Before AI Takes Over

*How much longer will I have a job before the AI overlords become sentient?*

That title was clickbait.

- discuss trends: data processing, user interfaces, standardization

- upcoming projects: widely applicable projects (`AutoMemo v2`), new territory (`clustering project`), etc.
